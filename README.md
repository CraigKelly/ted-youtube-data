# Working with TED Talks on YouTube

## Prep and Requirements

TODO: where to get the 2 CSV files?

Everything in this project is build on the expectation that the two CSV files
`ted_talks_raw.csv`  and `yt_ted_raw.csv` are already present.

You also need [dmk](https://github.com/CraigKelly/dmk) and Python 3. You will
also need some Python 3 libraries that your system might not have installed by
default:

* requests
* beautifulsoup4
* html5lib

To install these to your local user location (instead of the global system
location), you can run:

```
pip3 install --user requests beautifulsoup4 html5lib
```

## Running
