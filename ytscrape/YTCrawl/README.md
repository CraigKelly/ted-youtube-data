# YTCrawl Manual-Fork README

This sub directory was cloned from: https://github.com/yuhonglin/YTCrawl

You should see the file OLD-README.md for details.

`ytids.txt` was the original source file used to crawl YouTube.

A Python REPL session was used to batch_crawl YouTube: the old README.md file
for details on using batch_crawl.

The original output directory was compressed into ytcrawl.tar.gz in our
parent directory.
